This was the first version of the ground-assistant, and also my first publication ever, so there is no documentation and you will probably find many uncommon things.
This Version is not up to date anymore, but the newer version 1.0.0 provides different fuunctions. 
So if you need help understanding the code, E-Mail me: eliservices.server@gmail.com
