# EliServices Ground-Assistant (Moved to repo Ground-Assistant)

!!! This repository is outdated, the new versions will get uploaded on repo Ground-Assistant. I did this because I discovered travis and git recently, and opening a new repo is just cleaner. !!!

I can't guarrante that the versions are stable!

Above are the versions of the Ground-Assistant library, including the PyPi files and a Desktop Application in 1.1.0

This project is not finished yet, i can't guarantee that the program work on your PC.

It was build on latest Ubuntu Server LTS build with python 3.8.

You are free to use the code for non-commercial purposes, if you mention me (EliServices) somewhere next to it.
